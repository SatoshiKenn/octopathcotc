After you login into the administration page you can add a character,
for this example I already add to the application a sprite and art for
a specific character, you can use in the images fields the name: "Erika.png",
in that way you can see how the api add the complete path for the image to
display it in the other pages. If you don't use the correct name it will not
find anything to display and you will see a broken image.
