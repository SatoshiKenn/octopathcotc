# Application Description

In this application you will have the opportunity to check the details of the
travelers in the game, the main feature is to save in local storage your
favorite travelers, so you can check them a lot faster (Thinking that the game
has more than 150 characters already).

Another feature I added is the login page for the admin users, in this way the
admin can enter to the Add new character form in order to add a new character to
the database ins postgresql, and that's another feature I added, to create new
characters in order to display the information and details for the different
users.

# Add traveler instructions

Login credentials:
-Username: admin@admin.com
-Password: 12345678

After you login into the administration page you can add a character,
for this example I already add to the application a sprite and art for
a specific character, you can use in the images fields the name: "Tressa.png"
for the first image and "Tressa.jpg" for the second image in that way you can
see how the api add the complete path for the image to display it in the other
pages. If you don't use the correct name it will not find anything to display
and you will see a broken image.
